# obstacle_detection

This is the obstacle detection code along with the testing files and arduino library.
As shown in the diagram, the SCL and SDA of all distance sensors are connected to SCL and SDA bus of Arduino nano. 
The SHUT pins of all sensor are connected to D4, D5, and D6 of Arduino nano, respectively. 
3 haptic motors each connects to D9, D10, and D11 pins.
